One year after the the first release of its Bot Platform, Telegram announces new tools for it: Bot Platform 2.0

> Today we are giving bot developers a whole new dimension with Bots 2.0: inline keyboards, callback and URL buttons, location permissions and on-the-fly message editing. The new bots can also generate any type of content for you to share with friends, including documents, MP3s, videos, stickers, animations and contacts.

Telegram have already released some Bot’s example to try out the new capabilities:

* [@music](https://telegram.me/music)
* [@youtube](https://telegram.me/youtube)
* [@foursquare](https://telegram.me/foursquare)
* [@sticker](https://telegram.me/sticker)

(you must update your app to the last version).

See the [Documentation about Telegram Bot API 2.0](https://core.telegram.org/bots/2-0-intro)

But, if you are not a coder and you would like to test the potential of Telegram’s Bot, you can start with [Chatfuel](http://chatfuel.com) and the possible integration with [Zapier]( https://zapier.com/zapbook/chatfuel).

### Youtube introduces 360-degree live streaming and spatial audio

After the launch of support for 360 degrees videos, Youtube makes another step towards virtual reality: now its platform allows for streaming with 360 degree technology and spacial audio effects

> Just as watching a concert in 360 degrees can give you an unmatched immersive experience, spatial audio allows you to listen along as you do in real life, where depth, distance and intensity all play a role.

Youtube works with companies like **VideoStitch** and **Two Big Ears** to make their software compatible with 360-degree live streams or spatial audio. 360-degree live streaming and spatial audio technologies are avaliable at all [YouTube Space locations around the globe](https://www.youtube.com/yt/space/), for people who wants to try this experience.
