### Our history

*SparkFabrik* is the stable release of Twinbit and Agavee.

Over a long period of partnership on projects which required the joint effort of both companies, a perfect matching of skills, methods, and purposes emerged. This moved us closer as developers and showed we were pursuing the very same goals.
Both entities core businesses were founded on Drupal and other strategic tools and technologies which allowed us to design and develop reliable high quality web applications.

Merging was the natural end of this journey. In SparkFabrik we have channelled all the skills and knowledge of two teams who learned to work as one, share the same vision and want to deal with ambitious projects.
